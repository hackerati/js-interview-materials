The Hackerati's Interviewatorium
--------------------------------

This is a place for all things Hackerati interview. I added a few javascript assignments and live coding challenges to get the ball rolling.

Everyone should add a folder for their specific flavor of programming! It would be nice if we could add the challenges in advance of our next interview.
