AngularJS Interview 1
---------------------

Given a json file, create a custom directive to display the date in a table. This can be live coding. Remember, conversation during this is key to check for understanding of main concepts like Services (factories vs services vs providers), Directives (restrictions and linking), Controllers, Expressions, and Modules

Table should be:
- sortable on all fields
- searchable on a specified field that can be selected from a dropdown
- be flexible enough to accept a different json file
- potentially pass the json file in through an attribute, or scope the json in a way that is accessible to the directive.


Even though this is a small assignment, make sure they organize their code the same way they would in a large angular app. Make sure they use a service to get the json, make sure their controller doesn't have business logic, make sure they understand modules and Angular's dependency injector.

Last thing, when an opportunity presents itself, ask about the digest cycle in Angular and how its different than normal event handling in web browsers.
